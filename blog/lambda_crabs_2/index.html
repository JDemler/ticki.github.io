<p>This post will cover region (lifetime) inference with a mathematical and type
theoretical focus.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem:c70e7a562d412474947a41ef47c81d75">The problem</h2>

<p>Inference is a very handy concept. We no longer have to annotate redundant
types, which is a major pain point in languages, that lacks of type inference.</p>

<p>Now, we want such an inference scheme for regions as well.</p>

<p>We described the problem of region inference in <a href="/blog/lambda_crabs_1/">last post</a> as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, this is just a classical optimization problem:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; minimize    'a
&gt; subject to  A, B, C...
&gt;
&gt; A, B, C… are outlives relations. ‘a may or may not be free in those.
&gt; ```

Namely, we want to minimize some lifetimes, while holding some conditions.

## &quot;Adding&quot; regions

One thing we will use throughout the region inference algorithm is the notion of &quot;adding&quot; lifetimes.

You may have seen `'a + 'b` before. Intuitively, `'a: 'b + 'c` is equivalent to
`'a: 'b, 'a: 'c`, but we can go further and use `'a + 'b` as a way to construct
new regions:

Define `'a + 'b` as the smallest region that outlives both 'a and 'b.

In a sense, you &quot;widen&quot; the region until it covers both regions:

</code></pre>

<p>&lsquo;a:       I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I
&lsquo;b:            I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I
&lsquo;a + &lsquo;b:  I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;I</p>

## Funky but useless: Regions under addition as an abelian semigroup

A semigroup is an algebraic structure satisfying two properties:

1. Closure, for any a, b in S, a + b is contained in S.
2. Associativity, for any a, b, and c in S, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

But in contrary to monoids, there is no identity element.

&quot;Abelian&quot; means commutative. That is, a + b = b + a.

And, in fact, regions follows all these rules, making it an abelian semigroup.

We know to additional facts about our operator:

1. It follows from the fact 'a: 'a, that a + a = a
2. It follows from the fact 'static: 'a for all 'a, that ∃s∈L  ∀a∈L  s + a = s

## Directed Acyclic Graphs

A directed acyclic graph is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles.
That is, any arbitrary directed walk in the graph will &quot;end&quot; at some point.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Polytree.svg)

Let's forget the `'a: 'a` case for a moment. As such, the regions under our
_strict_ outlive relation, _&lt;_, forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

In particular, if to node are connected, with a directed edge A → B, A
represents a region, which _outlives_ B.

Consider we take a reference `&amp;'b T` where `T: 'a`

</code></pre>

<p>&lsquo;static

&lsquo;a &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-\
 |           |
 |           |
 |           |
 v           v
&lsquo;b &mdash;&mdash;-&gt; &lsquo;a + &lsquo;b
```</p>

<h2 id="handling-cycles:c70e7a562d412474947a41ef47c81d75">Handling cycles</h2>

<p>Every lifetime outlives itself, as explained in the last post. So our outlives
relation doesn&rsquo;t form a DAG, due to these cycles.</p>

<p>The solution is relatively simple, though.</p>

<p>Let {&lsquo;a, &lsquo;b, &lsquo;c, &hellip;} be cyclic such that <code>'a &lt; 'b &lt; 'c ... &lt; 'a</code>. Due to
transitivity and antisymmetry, we can assume that &lsquo;a = &lsquo;b = &lsquo;c = &hellip;, thus we
can, without loss of generality, collapse the cycle into a single node.</p>

<p>This lets us interpret the graph, where edges represents outlives relations, as
a DAG.</p>

<h2 id="recursively-widening-the-regions:c70e7a562d412474947a41ef47c81d75">Recursively widening the regions</h2>

<p>Say we want to infer the span of some node &lsquo;a. Assume &lsquo;a neighbors (outlives)
&lsquo;b, &lsquo;c, &rsquo;d&hellip;</p>

<p>Since we know the bound, we can say &lsquo;a = &lsquo;b + &lsquo;c + &rsquo;d + &hellip;, since this is the
smallest &lsquo;a subject to the outlives conditions.</p>

<p>Now, recursively do the same with &lsquo;b, &lsquo;c, &rsquo;d, &hellip; Since the graph is acyclic,
this will terminate at some point.</p>

<p>On an implementation note: you can optimize this process by 1. deduplicating
the regions, 2. collapsing sums containing &lsquo;static into &lsquo;static, 3. caching the
nodes to avoid redundant calculations.</p>
